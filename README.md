# Minimizing the Cost Function
Implement a linear regression model on the dataset to predict the total number of comments a post will
receive in next H hours. You are not allowed to use any available implementation of the regression
model. You should implement the gradient descent algorithm with batch update (all training examples
used at once). Use the sum of squared error normalized by 2*number of samples [J(β0, β1) =
(1/2m)[∑(yᶺ(i) – y(i))2
] as your cost and error measures, where m is number of samples. You can use any
number of features greater than 10. You can decide on which features to use using some
experimentation and exploratory analysis.
